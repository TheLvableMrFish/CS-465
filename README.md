Architecture
•	Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
I used Express to generate HTML it used components similar to when I used JavaScript allowing me to break the entire thing into parts and only have to create the header and footer once, with Angular and creating a single-page application it felt even more modular creating pieces with JavaScript. 
•	Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
I think part of the reason we wanted to use this was it was very flexible in terms of creating new additions like if we wanted to start displaying something new in the MongoDB for only certain items, we could. It allows use to create something and change it later and has strong scalability. 

Functionality
•	How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON uses key-value pairs and is very similar to creating objects in JavaScript. JavaScript is a full-on programming language and can be used for the full-stack development. JSON can be used to structure the data and all0ow for the use of RESTful APIs which can be used with JavaScript.
•	Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
When going from plain HTML we switched to Express to create the trips page which allowed us to call the header and footer files more dynamically, which when adding the rest of the HTML pages would allow us to only have to call them once and if changes needed to be made, we would only have to change it once.

Testing
•	Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
After testing with postman, I was able to check to see if the data I was looking to get was able to be received correctly. This allowed me to test endpoints like trips and trips/:TripCode. With security it allowed use to create a unique token with a time limit that would allow our admin user to make changes but keep other users out from making changes to the site. 

Reflection
•	How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has allowed to get experience with MongoDB while also taking another class introducing MongoDB cs-340 and allowed for me to have experience using HTML, JavaScript, Postman, Express, Angular, and uploading my project to git and taught me to make branches.
